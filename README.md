# Test Project

Test Project is a rather non-creative name for a simple category/product management system created as a test project, and to provide publicly visible sample code.

Test Project is built on a hand-coded MVC microframework based on some general design principles borrowed from the Yii framework.  It provides basic CRUD functionality against a MySQL database, with minimal validation and no user authentication.  It also includes a very basic REST API.
